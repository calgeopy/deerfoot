This is a project by calgeopy. A group of geoscience hackers in Calgary that get together to learn and share python.

The idea behind our first project was to create something simple building off of what has already been done. We 
chose to build a GUI around welly by Agile Geoscience.

This app simily plots a few curves and crossplots user selected curves.
